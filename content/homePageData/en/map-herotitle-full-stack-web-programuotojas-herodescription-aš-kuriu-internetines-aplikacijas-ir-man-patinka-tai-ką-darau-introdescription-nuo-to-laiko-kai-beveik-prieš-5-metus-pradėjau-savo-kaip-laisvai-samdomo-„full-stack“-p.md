introTitle: Hi, I’m Mantas. Nice to meet you.
introDescription: Since beginning my journey as a freelance full-stack developer
  nearly 5 years ago, I’ve done remote work for small companies and collaborated
  with talented people. I am constantly improving my website development and
  design skills, adapting them for both business and personal use. I’m
  confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving. I have
  graduated from the Kaunas University of Technology with a bachelor's degree in
  Informatics. That gave me gave me the basics to work in a quality and
  purposeful way.
